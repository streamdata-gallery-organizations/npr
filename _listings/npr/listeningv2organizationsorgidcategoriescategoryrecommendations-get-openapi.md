      description: |-
        If the parameters passed to this endpoint are correct, it will redirect to `npr.org/oauth2/login` for the user to complete the sign-in.

        Currently acceptable values for `scope` are any combination of the following:
        - `identity.readonly` - for read-only access to the Identity Service
        - `identity.write` - for write access to the Identity Service
        - `listening.readonly` - for read-only access to the Listening Service
        - `listening.write` - for write access to the Listening Service
        - `localactivation` - for all access to the Local Activation Service

        It is generally suggested that you assume that you will need all of the current scopes in order to successfully implement an NPR One application.

        If the parameters passed in are NOT correct and the client passed in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error={{ERROR_TYPE}}&message={{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}`.
        If the parameters passed are NOT correct and the client did not pass in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, this endpoint will return the errors encoded as JSON objects (along with the corresponding HTTP status code -- usually 400).
        The latter is intended for development and debugging purposes -- in a real-world situation, errors returned as JSON objects are irretrievable by the client application, and thus passing in a valid `redirect_uri` is critical even for the purpose of capturing errors.

        If the user successfully logs in and authorizes the application, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`

        If the user DENIES the application, they will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error=denied&message=The%20user%20has%20denied%20the%20login%20and%20access%20request&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`.
        This means that if your application flow requires a user to log in in order to proceed, it is up to you to give them the proper messaging explaining that the sign-in must be authorized in order to continue.

        Finally, please do not confuse an authorization code with an access token. Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /authorization/v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.

        This flow should only be used by clients who cannot show a native webview or do not have advanced input controls. It is an alternative to `GET /authorization/v2/authorize`.

        Third-party clients will need to use one or the other of these two endpoints, but they will generally not use both.

    post:
      summary: Create a new OAuth2 access token
      description: |-
        Please be aware that the required parameters are contingent on the `grant_type` that you select.

        For the `authorization_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters. `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `client_credentials` grant type, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `device_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` parameter. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        For the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. If you are logging in via a social service, you should also pass in the `service` parameter. (In this case, the access token you receive from the social service will serve as both your username and password.) The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.
        Third-party developers do not have access to this grant type.

        For the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        The `temporary_user` and `anonymous_user` grant types are custom grant types created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to these grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.
        For these grant types, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.

        If you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.

        Note that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec. For more information about our gradual rollout of this feature, please contact the NPR One API team.

  /authorization/v2/token/revoke:
    post:
      summary: Revoke an existing OAuth2 access token
      description: |-
        Our implementation follows the proposed IETF specification [RFC-7009](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009).

        If your client application offers the ability to for a logged-in user to log out, and you have access to a long-lived
        `client_credentials` token (i.e. you have generated one that you are storing securely for the lifetime of the entire app
        install), we suggest (but do not require) that you call this endpoint and revoke the access token belonging to the
        logged-in user as part of your logout process. If you do not already have a long-lived `client_credentials` token,
        please don't generate one just for the purposes of calling this endpoint.

        If you are building a prototype application, we also recommend that you use this endpoint to clean up access tokens
        that you generate during the testing of your app and do not intend to reuse.

        Note that revoking an access token will automatically revoke any refresh tokens associated with it, and vice-versa.
